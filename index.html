                    <h3>About Me.</h3> 
                    <p>My name is Emile Rose and I am
                    currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College. </p> 
                    <p>Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and
                        have gained experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe
                        Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch.</p> 
                    <p>I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also
                        had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as
                        motion graphics and web design.</p> 
                  </p>
